Description:
    Generate a LinkedItems class and migration for use with `has_linked :items`

Example:
    bin/rails generate linked_items thing

    This will create:
      - a new class, `ThingLink`, that works as a polymorphic join table between Thing and it's linked items
      - a migration for `ThingLink`
      - the declaration `has_linked :items` within the `Thing` class
    
    `has_linked :items` will add the following to `Thing`:
      - `has_many :linked_items, class_name: LinkClassName, dependent: :destroy`
      - `has_many :items, through: :linked_items, source: :item`
